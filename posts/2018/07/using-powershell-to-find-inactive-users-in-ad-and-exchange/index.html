<div class=post-content>
<p>Recently, I was working with a client to consolidate of several Active Directory and LDAP domains into a single unified domain. To ensure we were starting with a <em>clean slate</em>, one of the first steps I performed was an audit to find any inactive accounts in the Active Directory domains. This allowed the client to investigate and/or remove any stale accounts prior to consolidation. There are many professional (and possibly expensive) tools which can be used to automate this process, but for small to mid-sized domains, this can be done fairly easily using the following <strong>PowerShell</strong> command and some <strong>Excel</strong> manipulation.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-powershell data-lang=powershell>Get-AdUser -SearchBase <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;ou=users,dc=company,dc=com&#34;</span> -Filter * -Properties * | select SamAccountName, distinguishedName, LastLogonDate, Department, Title, Enabled | Export-Csv C:\Temp\AdUserLastLogonDate.csv
</code></pre></div><p>In this example, I have focused on the the <strong>users</strong> OU, although this script could be used to investigate stale computer or service accounts as well. While I only needed the user&rsquo;s account name and <em>LastLogonDate</em> in this report, I also included fields such as <em>Department</em> and <em>Title</em> to assist in identifying the users. The CSV file produced by <strong>PowerShell</strong> could then be opened in <strong>Excel</strong> to quickly locate any inactive accounts by sorting on the <em>LastLogonDate</em> field. That said, there are some specific issues to be aware of using this process.</p>
<ol>
<li>The <em>LastLogonDate</em> attribute can be out by up to 14 days (due to how this field is replicated in AD).</li>
<li>If the <em>LastLogonDate</em> is blank, this indicates the account has never logged in.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the information provided in this report, I was able to work with the client to identify stale accounts which could be removed or further investigated. In at least one case, using this report the client identified a service which had not been working in months and was only brought to their attention when the service account showed up as <em>inactive</em>.</p>
<p>Once this was done, the client decided to perform a similar audit of user mailboxes in Exchange. As above, this can be done fairly easily with a few <strong>PowerShell</strong> commands and <strong>Excel</strong>.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-powershell data-lang=powershell>$UserCredential = Get-Credential
$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https<span style=color:#960050;background-color:#1e0010>:</span>//outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection
Get-mailbox -OrganizationalUnit <span style=color:#e6db74>&#34;ou=users,dc=company,dc=com&#34;</span> -resultsize unlimited | Get-MailboxStatistics | select DisplayName, TotalItemSize, Itemcount, legacyDN, lastlogontime | Export-Csv C:\Temp\ExchangeMBOXReport.csv
</code></pre></div><p>In this example, the client mailboxes are hosted on <strong>Office 365</strong>. The first two commands are required to authenticate and connect to the <strong>Exchange Online PowerShell</strong> interface. Once connected, the <code>Get-Mailbox</code> command is used to export all user mailboxes, and filtered through the <code>Get-MailboxStatistics</code> command, giving the client a quick and dirty report of mailbox usage as well. Once again, the CSV file produced by <strong>PowerShell</strong> could be opened and manipulated in <strong>Excel</strong> to quickly locate any inactive mailboxes by sorting on the <em>lastlogontime</em> field.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in more complex environments where <strong>Blackberry BES</strong> (yes, that is still being used out there) or some other Server-Side Antivirus tools, the <em>lastlogontime</em> field may not be correct, as this date is updated every time the mailbox is scanned. In these cases, you will need to use a different process to identify <em>inactive</em> mailboxes. One possible way is to report based on the date of the last item in the <em>Sent Items</em> folder. Rather than get into the details here, I&rsquo;ll refer you to this <a href=https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/List-Inactive-Mailboxes-on-1ac82ddf target=_blank>article</a>
on the <strong>Microsoft Script Center</strong> which covers the process in depth.</p>
