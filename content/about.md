I maintain this website as my personal and professional portfolio. It is built using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com), who I highly recommend. As always, opinions expressed on this site are my own and not the views of my employers, past, present or future (or family and friends for that matter).

To contact me, use the [Contact](/contact) page, or send me a message on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thedeskofbrad).  

Take care.
