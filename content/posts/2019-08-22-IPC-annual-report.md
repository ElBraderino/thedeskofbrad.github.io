Earlier this summer, the Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC) of Ontario released their [2018 Annual Report](https://www.ipc.on.ca/2018-annual-report-privacy-and-accountability-for-a-digital-ontario/). One of the more interesting stories in the report concerned Privacy Order PO-3617. This order related to a lengthy dispute between the Ontario Medical Association (OMA) and Toronto Star, who requested the release of the top 100 OHIP billing physicians in Ontario. In April of this year, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the OMA’s appeal and allowed for the release of this information, which many have seen as a victory for government openness and transparency.

One of the hidden gems in the report is on page 18 where the Commissioner discusses a [three-volume set](https://www.ipc.on.ca/new-lesson-plans-for-educators-privacy-rights-digital-literacy-and-online-safety/) of lesson plans for educators which the IPC helped develop and release in 2018. While the lesson plans are focused primarily on the K – 12 environment, they are an excellent resource and could also be used in the development of Privacy and Information Security education programs for any organization. Included with the resources are links to additional materials developed by the IPC and the Office of the Privacy Commissioner (OPC) of Canada, such as:

-	[5 Tips to protect your privacy online](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/about-the-opc/what-we-do/awareness-campaigns-and-events/privacy-education-for-kids/educational-resources-for-teachers/educational-poster/)
-	[Social Smarts: privacy, the Internet and you](https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/about-the-opc/what-we-do/awareness-campaigns-and-events/privacy-education-for-kids/social-smarts-privacy-the-internet-and-you/)
-	[Identity Theft: A Crime of Opportunity](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/id-theft-e.pdf)

Also noted in the report, the IPC co-chaired a task force with the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada to research, create and sponsor a resolution at the 40th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners. This [resolution](https://icdppc.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/20180918_ICDPPC-40th_DEWG-Resolution_ADOPTED.pdf) includes 24 recommendations and guidance for protecting user privacy when developing, implementing, or using online educational services.

If you have any interest in Privacy, I recommend that you read the [report](https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ar-2018-e.pdf) and the education resources I highlighted, especially if you have a role in Education or Organizational Development.
