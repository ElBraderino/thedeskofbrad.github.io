I thought this odd as her system has a 500GB SSD, and last I checked it still had over 400GB free. To play it safe, I took a quick look at her system and found it had a new (and unknown) drive labeled D: with just under 50MB available. This was the drive causing the Low Disk Space warning.</description></item></channel></rss>
